# Summer 2021

Hello and welcome! Here are some links and instructions to help you around.


## Getting Started

New here?  Check out the [getting started](getting_started.md) readme.

## Slack
We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited. 

## Github
We recommend these tutorials if you are new to git: 

- [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

## Google Drive
If you need to create documents, spreadsheets and share them, feel free to create a folder named per your lastname in our shared [Google Drive Summer2021](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1njZeZ_OMHzq_Boqq-nnEhC31kd1-coqr) and link to your GitHub files. Send us you google email address via slack, so we can share trhat folder with you.

## Tiles 
To give you an opportunity to present yourself and to get to know the others we ask our students to fill out a google slide. You can find the template `Student_Quadchart_Template` in the google drive folder above.

## Daily blogs
This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. Please create a folder named per your last name.

[Here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2018/tree/master/morrison) is an example of a student space organization. Please follow it in organizing your space.


## Deliverables

For our SULI students there are four required deliverables:

1. Oral or Poster Presentation
2. One-page peer review
3. Abstract for General Audience
4. Research Report Paper

(Detailed instructions should have been shared with these students)


For all other interns we expect at the end of their internship:

1. Oral presentation
2. Abstract for General Audience (on github)
3. A white paper OR a real publication. In either case the daily blog on github can serve as a basis for the content. 4-8 pages, please use the LaTeX template or the overleaf template. No Microsoft Word please.  [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
