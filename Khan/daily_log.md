## Week 2 ##
### 6/7/2021
* Watched Youtube tutorials on OpenCV
    * Downloaded openCV library and set up local enviroment
    * learned how to read and write to files on openCV
    * learned how to detect objects based on hue, saturation, value of objects
* Cloned github project onto local enviroment, created daily_log, and README
* Uploaded sample images from google (one that seemed ordered and the other which seemed disordered)
  onto repository
* Created a method that detects the hue, saturation, and value of the images
* Read second half of research paper "The Nature-Disorder Paradox: A Perceptual Study on How
                                      Nature Is Disorderly Yet Aesthetically Preferred"
  
### 6/8/2021 ###
* Started Udacity course on Computer Vision
  * Watched introduction lectures
* Computed mean hsv of image
* Used Canny Edge Detection to detect the edges of given images
    * TODO: use this to detect density of edges
* Read research paper "The Nature-Disorder Paradox: A Perceptual Study on How Nature is
                        Disorderly Yet Aesthetically Preferred"
    * Found out that I should calculate mean and SD of hsv
* Finished Last 2 training assignments
* TODO:
    * Find Standard Deviations of hsv
    * Add Track bars
    
## 6/9/2021 ### 
* Attended seminar on "How and When Do I Go To Graduate School" (9- 10am)
* Had meeting with Writing coach                                (10:30 - 11:30 am)
* Continued Watching Udacity videos on Computer Vision
    * "Images as Functions" lecture
* Updated Payroll information on Workday
* Found standard deviations of hsv 
* Wrote test cases
    * Computing mean of hsv
    * Computing Standard Deviation of hsv
      * Still need to work on finding best way to test the standard deviation function
    
### 6/10/2021 ###
* Attended student connect meeting
* Wrote more test cases for standard deviation
* Watched Udacity video on canny edge detection
* Debugged logging into lcrc and was finally able to correcty log into lcrc through PuTTY :)
    * On Windows I should be using PuTTY instead of Command Prompt
      to log into lcrc
* Wrote method on finding edge density
    * Wrote test cases for finding edge density to make sure I calculated it correctly
    * Failed one test case where both images had very high edge densities
    * TODO:
        * Need to debug edge density calculations
        * Also need to contact Nicola to make sure I am understanding edge density 
          correctly and my thought process is correct about that for clarification
