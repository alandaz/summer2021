- NOELLE
  - The paper presents some extensions to the LLVM compiler framework
  - The problem with LLVM that NOELLE is trying to fix is that LLVM only focuses on low-level abstractions, but NOELLE has a combination of low-level and high-level abstractions
  - NOELLE uses a profiler that provides the following results
    - Hotness of code regions
    - Loop-specific information
    - Function-specific information
