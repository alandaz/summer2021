## Tasks Completed

- Completed onboarding

- Watched tutorials on Docker and installed the engine on my desktop

  - ```
    docker build -t [tag] .
    docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started
    ```
    
  - Watched part of a conference talk on containers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc
  
  - **docker-compose** - enables end users to spin up a docker image as a service
  
- Read overview papers on hardware profiling

  - https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~vahid/pubs/lctes03_profile.pdf
  - 90-10 rule that declares that small loops are usually responsible for the bulk of the execution time in an embedded program
  - Some profilers are specific to an instruction set
    - Compilation based and simulation based are the two broad categories for profilers
  - The proposed toolset is the Frequent Loop Analysis Toolset which can handle both paradigms of profiling (simulation, instrumentation) and supports many different architectures
  - In related work, many simulators and profilers are mentioned that may be of future use
  - **Cores** - routines of code that contain loops and make up a certain threshold of execution time
