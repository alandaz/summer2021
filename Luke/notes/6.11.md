## Tasks Completed

- Received Jetson NX devkit from Yongho because the other carrier board was giving me problems with flashing
- Flashed the uSD card for the NX successfully

## Notes

- There are a few methods to retrieve power/performance stats

  - The easiest is to run `tegrastats` which lists a variety of values like RAM usage, CPU utilization, and rough temperature numbers for various components:

    ```
    RAM 1625/7764MB (lfb 1117x4MB) SWAP 0/3882MB (cached 0MB) CPU [7%@1190,6%@1190,5%@1190,4%@1190,off,off] EMC_FREQ 0% GR3D_FREQ 0% AO@42C GPU@42.5C PMIC@100C AUX@42C CPU@43.5C thermal@42.6C
    ```

  - Another method is retrieving values from the /sys folder directly, but if tegrastats is sufficient then I don't see a need for interacting with the system values

- Trying to bridge the network connection of the NX over ethernet with my computer's wifi

  - The ethernet interface won't obtain an IP address so I decided to try to install a DHCP server, but that won't install properly so I guess I will just settle with having both devices on wifi

- Writing a Python interface to read/log performance stats

  - Right now I am going for a simple function that can execute tegrastats, read a line from stdout, parse that line into a dictionary and return the dictionary (each dictionary would then be one data point for temperature/usage values at that time)

- Reading through some research papers given to me by Chris

  - Amulet
    - Event-driven programming is energy-efficient
    - The Amulet Resource Profiler is of interest to us because it includes a firmware toolchain to predict an application's resource usage - they care about memory and energy
    - The device profile contains a number empirical values that say how much energy is consumed by each API call
      -  Being in charge of the testbed I should be aware of hardware accelerator and SOC usage because those change the power consumption
    - Power is computed by adding state transition energy costs to average sensor energy costs
    - **How can we use the profiler to turn off hardware components that are not necessary to an application, thus saving power and temperature losses?**
