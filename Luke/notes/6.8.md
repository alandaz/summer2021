## Tasks Completed

- Initial meeting with Yongho, Wolfgang, and Yomi 

## Notes

- Initial meeting
  - Focus on a resource limited computing environment
  - How to know an application's performance characteristics to help know when to run applications and how to run applications

  - The user provides a run script and test dataset
  - All versions stored in profiling database
  - A Python library interface is required to build inference code
  - The Dockerfile gives us the information needed to run the app, but the user will need to provide testing and profiling commands
  - A wrapper is needed for interfacing with the Python library

    - Dockerhub, use "docker run" and download and install automatically
    - How the ECR interacts with Jenkins
  - The format of an app repo
    - YAML file
  - Yomi's role
    - How to store profiling information?
    - What info does ECR need to build test applications?
  - Me

    - Some devices have different performance metrics
      - GPU on Dell Blade and NVIDIA NX but not on RPi
    - PEXI booting, provisioning requires the understanding of drivers
      - Ansible?
      - Image loader
  - Chris
    - His profiling program will work on the device hardware that I will configure
    - Profiling user requirements
