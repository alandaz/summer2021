## Tasks Completed

- Setup Jenkins on my host desktop and the NX, debugging a socket permissions issue that had to do with user groups on the NX

## Notes

- Researching how to use Jenkins and how it can be setup on my machine as a server to manage the NX
  - I will need to create a `Jenkinsfile` to automate the profiling instances that will be run
  - A Jenkinsfile is composed with Declarative Pipeline syntax
  - I have setup a simple Pipeline instance that runs a Docker image of Python
