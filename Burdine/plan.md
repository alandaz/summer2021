# Daily Progress Report

## Week -1 ##
### Wednesday May 19, 2021 ###
- Set up a student intern directory in waggle-sensor/summer2021.
- Wrote this plan file.

### Thursday May 27, 2021 ###
- Read through the onboarding README document [here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2021/blob/main/getting_started.md)
- Obtained remote access credentials for the LCRC and Waggle projects.
-  Briefly skimmed the `Software_Development_Process_v1.1` document on the Agile Scrum Process drive folder.
    * Will go back and cover the document content in detail on my starting day.
- Learned about the system architecture and contents of the SAGE and Waggle repositories.
- Successfully built the waggle-edge-stack project.
    * Will need to ask some clarification questions regarding the status of `virtual-waggle` versus `waggle-edge-stack`.
- Completed HR paperwork (I9 and other hiring documents).

## Week 0 ##
### Tuesday June 1, 2021 ###
- Completed Pending Workday tasks.
- Attended Day 1 of virtual orientation.
- Finished the following TMS traning modules:
    * SEC152 (OUO Training)
    * HR498  (Ethics Training)
    * HR720  (Employee Conflict of Interest)
    * HR497  (Sexual Harassment Prevention)
    * JHQ100 (Job & Hazard Questionnaire)

- Met with Sean, Nicola, and Scott to discuss project assignments for the summer.
    * (My project assignment is still TBD)

### Wednesday June 2, 2021 ###
- Successfully built and trained the facemask identification 'hello world' waggle plugin from 
[this repository](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin-helloworld-ml).
- Attended Day 2 of virtual orientation.
- Finished the SEC101 (CounterIntelligence Training)
- Spoke with Sean about work on object tracking with OpenCV
- Began [notes on OpenCV Object Tracking](notes/opencv_tracking.pdf)
- Started work on an experimental OpenCV image tracking plugin: [plugin-motion-detector](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin-motion-detector)

### Thursday June 3, 2021 ###
- Completed ESH100 (ES&H Orientation)
- Completed ESH196A (Hazard Communication)
- Read through the [Bolme paper on MOSSE filters](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/papers/bolme_cvpr10.pdf) for object tracking.
- Did a brief review of FFT (convolution and correlation theorems, as shown [here](http://ugastro.berkeley.edu/infrared/ir_clusters/convolution.pdf)).

### Friday Hune 4, 2021 ###
- Finished notes on MOSSE filters, which can be found [here](notes/opencv_tracking.pdf).
- Read up on the existing (cross-platform?) docs for opencv
    * I'm still a bit confused about the translation between the standard C++ api and the python api. The bindings seem autogenerated, which means that they mimic the C++ api with high fidelity, but there are some packaging quirks that are not well documented (such as their legacy packages).
- Implemented MOSSE filters in the plugin-motion-detection repository.
    * I still need permissions to commit to this repo; I am commiting locally on my machine.

## Week 1 ##
### Monday June 7, 2021 ###
- Wrote some manual logic to handle the detection of occluded objects in `plugin-motion-detector`
- Did some reading on the YOLO model paper
    * The YOLO model seems to yield good results, but may not perform well in a general object detection setting, so custom models may need to be trained to detect "canonical" objects in the deployment setting

    * 
### Tuesday June 8, 2021 ###
- Imported part of the KITTI multi-object tracking dataset for autonomous vehicles
    * This dataset is quite large (and the image aspect ratios are non-standard), so it requires a lot of cleaning.
    * This dataset may serve as a good proof-of-concept for tranferring the YOLO model to a specific use case, given a clean, labeled dataset.

- Obtained push permissions for the `plugin-motion-detector` repository.

### Wednesday, June 9, 2021 ###
- Continued work on training YOLO on the KITTI vehicle detection dataset
