## Week 1 

<br />

### June 1, 2021 (Day 1)

Updates:
* Finished Day 1 of orientation
* Met with Dr. Nicola Ferrier and Dr. Scott Collis for group meeting, talked about project topics and some suggestions for light readings and prep.
* Still figuring things out around the lab.

To Do:
* Look into PyImage and other sources to help with OpenCV.

Thoughts:
* Very excited to work with my new team and to learn new material!

<br />

### June 2, 2021 (Day 2)

Updates:
* Finished Day 2 of orientation.
* Met with Dr. Todd Munson and student connect group - aka .
* PyImage is expensive. Found an alternative to learn OpenCV through [YT tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K). Will be binging those.
* Managed to run Docker on Windows 10 Home. Confirmed this through following shared [Docker YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S73WERRqO4).

To Do:
* Pre-SULI Survey, other Argonne forms/trainings, finish Getting Started portion of Waggle GitHub.
* Crash course through OpenCV.

Thoughts:
* Still getting accustomed to remote work and SULI/Argonne.

<br />

### June 3, 2021 (Day 3)

Updates:
* Attended welcome meeting by Dr. Rick Stevens and CELS Student Lecture by Dr. Sarah Owens.
* Approved of LCRC account. Set up SSH successfully (after lots of trial and error).

To Do:
* Training modules for working at Argonne. Lots of them.
* Look at past SAGE projects.

### June 4, 2021 (Day 4)

Updates:
* Met with Dr. Nicola Ferrier to discuss project topic. Will be tinkering around with OpenCV and other derivatives of it, finding ways to measure snow using sticks. For greater applications, finding how to do a more semi-supervised approach to machine learning in terms of training data.
* Project Guiding Question: Can we use ML but reduce the human effort required for training?
* Project Goal: Snow level detection with NEON poles.

To Do:
* Complete training modules for working at Argonne. Lots of them.
* Seek inspiration for OpenCV ideas from online repositories and literature. 
* Look into CVAT.
* Find educational sources for ML packages, specifically Deep Learning and/or PyTorch for OpenCV.

Thoughts:
* Excited and nervous to have project idea and goals laid out. Will be a big learning curve for computer vision, but I am confident I will overcome it.

### June 7, 2021 (Day 5)

Updates:
* Finished most or all of training.
* Forked Summer 2021 Waggle GitHub repository and cloned onto my PC.
* Completed OpenCV YT tutorials up to 13. YT user generously provided his code, and I have been tinkering around with them. They can be found in Summer 2021 repository as [open_cv_demo](https://github.com/thejeffreyli/summer2021/tree/main/Li/opencv_demos).
* Topics Covered: Reading Images (3), Reading Input Videos (4), Drawing Shapes (5), Setting Camera Parameters (6), Setting Text (7), Mouse Events (8-9), Image Operations (10), Bitwise Operations (11), Trackbar (12), Object Detection and Tracking with HSV (13)

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.

### June 8, 2021 (Day 6)
Updates:
* Completed OpenCV YT tutorials up to 16.
* Topics Covered: Simple Image Thresholding (14), Adaptive Thresholding (15), matplotlib (16)

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.

### June 9, 2021 (Day 7)
Updates:
* Attended seminar 'When and How Do I Go to Graduate School?' by Dr. Bruce A. Lindvall, Assistant Dean of Graduate Admissions at Northwestern McCormick School of Engineering
* Attended student connect session with 'Caffeinated Camels'
* Attended introductory writing coach session led by Dr. Robert Boomsma. Talked about scientific writing, story telling, and resources. 
* Felt feverish throughout the day and wanted to rest. Did not get much work done on tutorial.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.

### June 10, 2021 (Day 8)
Updates:
* Completed OpenCV YT tutorials up to 20.
* Topics Covered: Morphological Transformations (17), Smoothing Images (18), Image Gradients and Edge Detection (19), Canny Edge Detection (20).
* Started developing code for the NEON poles. Worked with object detection with HSV first, results were very unclear. Then I applied edge detection methods. After adjustments, Canny appeared best.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.
* Gather more image data from NEON.

### June 11, 2021 (Day 9)
Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Discussed results from initial tests on NEON poles. Next steps will be line detection and image segmentation.
* Acquired access to repository of NEON poles images. Will be useful for training models.
* Worked and finalized PowerPoint Presentation for Monday.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.
* Look into deep learning and other tools, potentially. 

### June 14, 2021 (Day 10)
Updates:
* Meeting with entire group. Presented introdutory research project PowerPoint.
* Completed OpenCV YT tutorials up to 24.
* Topics Covered: Image Pyramid (21), Image Blending (22), Find and Draw Contours (23), Motion Detection and Tracking with Contours (24).

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.
* Need to ramp up project pace! Exciting things ahead.
