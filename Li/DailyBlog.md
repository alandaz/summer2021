### June 1, 2021 (Day 1)

Updates:
* Finished Day 1 of orientation
* Met with Dr. Nicola Ferrier and Dr. Scott Collis for group meeting, talked about project topics and some suggestions for light readings and prep.
* Still figuring things out around the lab.

To Do:
* Look into PyImage and other sources to help with OpenCV.

Thoughts:
* Very excited to work with my new team and to learn new material!

### June 2, 2021 (Day 2)

Updates:
* Finished Day 2 of orientation.
* Met with Dr. Todd Munson and student group.
* PyImage is expensive. Found an alternative to learn OpenCV through YT tutorials. Currently binging those.
* Managed to run Docker on Windows 10 Home. Confirmed this through following shared YT tutorial.

To Do:
* Pre-SULI Survey, other Argonne forms/trainings, finish Getting Started portion of Waggle GitHub.
* Crash course through OpenCV.

Thoughts:
* Still getting accustomed to remote work and SULI/Argonne.

### June 3, 2021 (Day 3)

Updates:
* Attended welcome meeting by Dr. Rick Stevens and CELS Student Lecture by Dr. Sarah Owens.
* Approved of LCRC account. Set up SSH successfully (after lots of trial and error).
To Do:
* Training modules for working at Argonne. Lots of them.
* Look at past SAGE projects.

Thoughts:
* xx

### June 4, 2021 (Day 4)

Updates:
* Met with Dr. Nicola Ferrier to discuss project topic. Will be tinkering around with OpenCV and other derivatives of it, finding ways to measure snow using sticks. For greater applications, finding how to do a more semi-supervised approach to machine learning in terms of training data.

To Do:
* Training modules for working at Argonne. Lots of them.
* Acquire greater proficiency in computer vision / ML packages and seek inspiration from tutorials and online repositories.

Thoughts:
*
